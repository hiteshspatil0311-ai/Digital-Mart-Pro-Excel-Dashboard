# Digital-Mart-Pro-Excel-Dashboard

🚀 New Excel Dashboard Project – Digital Mart Pro | Sales & Profit Insights<br>

Thrilled to share a dynamic, fully interactive Excel dashboard I recently created to analyze multi-category sales performance across regions for Digital Mart Pro.<br>

This dashboard brings together:<br>
📊 Regional Sales Breakdown – Clear visualization of how North, South, East, and West contribute to overall performance.<br>
📈 Monthly Profit Trend – A quick glance at profit movement across Jan–Mar.<br>
🛒 Category & Product-Level Insights – Identify top-performing items with a combined Sales–Profit view.<br>
🗂️ Treemap Analysis – Understand how categories (Accessories, Electronics, FMCG, Furniture, Stationery) contribute within each region.<br>
🎛️ Interactive Filters – Month and Region slicers for seamless exploration.<br>

Key Learnings:<br>
✔ Importance of clean UI/UX in Excel dashboards<br>
✔ How different visualizations can uncover hidden trends<br>
✔ Practical experience with data modeling & storytelling<br>
